# Final-SE-Project

This project is a Service learning project as a part of Saint Mary's University's Service Learning program. This is a personalized emailing system intended
for autistic students at Autism Nova Scotia.

The requirements for the project is listed in package.json.

Since the server and database for the project is not functional at the moment, the project will not run but I have included this code here as reference 
for our project from Software Engineering class - Fall 2020.
